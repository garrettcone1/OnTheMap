# OnTheMap

This app will work with creating pins on a map and allow you to add your own personal URL. This URL can be a link to your own website, resume, etc.

### How to Use
1. Download the app onto your Desktop, and open the EventSearch.xcodeproj
2. Click the Run button in the upper left corner
3. When the app launches, you are prompted to sign in with your Udacity credentials, or create a new profile
4. Once logged in, you will be able to view all other pins from other Udacity students and where they are studying
5. You can create your own pin by clicking the "+" button in the upper right corner
6. Enter in your city/location, and personal URL
7. Once you create your pin, you will be able to see all other pins along with yours as well in a MapView, and a TableView
